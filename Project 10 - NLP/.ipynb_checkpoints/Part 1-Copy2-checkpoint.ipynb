Other dropping the outlier data, we have no other way to deal with classification material. Usually it is desirable to have retention of last certain number of words within the blog, as it contains summary of the whole blog and is likely to help in classification.

spongebob is on hehehe.. but yah i need to write more often in here. it feels like i never write.. meh.. im gonna go make sum lunch my tummy hurts .. bye bye  **lots of love and saliva -- kira**  ranted: march.4th 2004 feeling:fine.. if i could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. the long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience i will dispense this advice now. enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. but trust me, in 20 years you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. you’re not as fat as you imagine.   don’t worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. the real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle tuesday.   do one thing everyday that scares you   sing don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts, don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.   floss   don’t waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind the race is long, and in the end, it’s only with yourself.   remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.   keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.   stretch   don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life the most interesting people i know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds i know still don’t.   get plenty of calcium. be kind to your knees, you’ll miss them when they’re gone.   maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll have children, maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll divorce at 40, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary what ever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either your choices are half chance, so are everybody else’s. enjoy your body, use it every way you can don’t be afraid of it, or what other people think of it, it’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own..   dance even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room. read the directions, even if you don’t follow them. do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly. get to know your parents, you never know when they’ll be gone for good.   be nice to your siblings; they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.   understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on. work hard to bridge the gaps in geography in lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.   live in new york city once, but leave before it makes you hard; live in northern california once, but leave before it makes you soft.   travel.   accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do you’ll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.   respect your elders.   don’t expect anyone else to support you. maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.   don’t mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.   be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and selling it for more than it’s worth.   but trust me on the sunscreen!

who think like i do.. its soo hard to be alone in my thoughts all the time.. i feel so insane.. abnormal.. i mean i cant carry on a conversation with anyone about the way i think becuz then their like..o. yah.. i see what u mean.. well... im not gonna talk about this anymore.. cuz.. i dont really understand.. *sigh* am i just really insane?? is there really anyone else out there that actully has the mind to talk about like different shit.. i mean.. talking about.. sex.. and girls.. and guys.. and clothes is sooo fuckin boring.. people need to open up their mind too new things like just explore different possibilities.. maybe thats why im soo depressed all the time.. cuz im just so.. screwed up in the head and i think about crazzy things and theories.. yah im just insane.. i wish i was like everyone else sumtimes.. all involved in worldly things.. fuck.. no one understands.. whoevers reading this right now is probably like 'ooo lord that girl needs sum major phsyschiatric help' oorrr is probably saying im quite weird.. which i am be weird with my for christ sakes lol i need sumone weird.. sumone who can talk to me about time travel and different dimensions and all that jazz.. and if ur wondering why im talking like this.. i just watched donnie darko.. it was the most amazing movie ever!!.. watch it.. maybe u'll be enlightened and start thinking a little differently.. a little abnormally.. ive realized.. ive just put on a mask my whole life to be this person thats considered normal to society.. and normal to all my so called 'friends'.. but now i think its time i take it off.. becuz.. im not me and it sucks.. this world that we live in has put 'normal' into a small box.. and if u think or look or act outside of the box.. ur not normal or accepted.. people need to be more accepting.. not being normal is what everyone fears the most.. but really its what we all need to be.. becuz apparently.. if i think about dying... im insane.. and i needa go on pills or see a phsychiatrist.. but i dont.. this is just the way i am.. its time we stop trying to diagnose.. certain things that we call 'problems' and just.. u know embrace them .. and embrace different outlooks and embrace different people.. becuz if we had that life would be verryy different.. and hopefully a better place.. but anyways.. im insane.. and i ramble.. so i shall go

alchohol.. solve all my little problems.. it seems ive lost.. all my friends.. but.. i dont really think ive ever had any real friends.. well not as many as most people think they have .. i really cant live in this city anymore it brings me down.. i donno if its the people or my family or both.. i mean as soon as i get home theres somthing my family is fighting about.. and i just really dont wanna be here anymore.. its so depressing.. this atmosphere is just so bad for me.. i needa get a job.. i have no life.. i stay up all night watching shitty court shows.. and i sleep until 5 in the evening every day.. what a life eh. i mean theres the occasional going outage.. but i dono i dont even wanna do that anymore.. theres not really anyone i can talk to .. im sure my depression and anti socialness isnt to the point where i need phsychiatric help.. all hes gonna say is 'your depressed and anti social..here how bout sum anti anxiety drugs and antidepressants that'll do that job' and then he gets paid for telling me sumthing i already knew and putting me on shit that doesnt really fix the problem but masks it.. makes me feel numb.. emotionless.. and most people dont even hafta deal with that kinda shit.. but no i had to be the acception... i mean my life isnt even half bad. my parents are assholes.. my dad and my mom dont have a job.. my little brother doesnt have any friends and doesnt go to school either.. im freakin high school drop out whos lost all her friends.. and i have a brother thats retarded and likes to piss me off.. i live in low income housing.. my parents can barely afford to pay the bills and go grocerie shopping.. wow im livin it up arent i? sum would say so.. like the dying children in africa.. buti donno dude.. considering the place i live in.. this is shit.. compared to everyone else i know whos got all they ever wanted and still complains .. sure i get clothes with my own money and sure my parents dont give a flying fuck about what i do with my life.. but at least u guys have sumone that pushes u to make sumthing of urself.. and doesnt give up on u.. like people have given up on me.. im a hopeless case. theres no hope in me ever becoming sumthing.... sumthing that'll make me money get me married with a huge house and.. 2.5 children.. and a stupid suv that pollutes the atmosphere and is slowly killing off the human race.. while we sit around all comfy in our little homes with our little familys and our stupid insignificant jobs.. that wont even matter when we're dead and have little worms crawling through the places we never wanted worms to crawl through in our bodies.. but i donno thats just my perspective on life.. its a peice of shit really.. and thats all i hafta say. life sucks.. annnd yah. bye  **love kira**

just wanna use me for their own amusement.. but whats the point anymore. dont u ever wish u could just fall asleep and never wake up.. im sure darkness would be the best place for me.. then no one can hurt me and.. i cant hurt anyone else.. i look around me.. everyones happy.. everyones laughing and having fun. i wanna be them.. i wanna be happy.. but i just get pushed around.. maybe im just to

**love kira**  ranted: jan.13th 2004 feeling:thoughful my secret kept me safe. i became addicted to pain that didn`t hurt, but instead felt nice. i engraved into my soul, on my soft flesh, with the silver blade, making deep imprints. the complex emotions leaked from my flesh in the form of blood, rather from my eyes in the form of tears. one cut followed by another, and another. the world seemed to blur and slow down, as the cuts left me calm. as i watched the crimsom tears slowly drip out of me.    every thought and every second that you smile, it makes me choke, it makes me bleed, they were all lies. your smile makes me sick  --- - ------------------------- - - ----- ------ ++++++++++ ++ + ++++++ ---- -- -- - it¡¯s so hard to say 'i love you', and to draw back the tears. to know that you¡¯re not there to help me face my fears. to know the phone¡¯s at reach, but i cannot hear your voice. to see you laughing when i`m crying deep inside. to just find feelings and not have to make them hide. its so hard to live without you, when i need you more then words. i want to scream how much i love you but hold back and not be heard. its so hard to go to sleepat night when i cannot dream of you. its so hard to think that you might fall in love with someone new. to start crying when i hear your favorite song, to sit and wonder, where did i go wrong? it`s so hard to live without you ifonly i would have known i willnever love another, i would rather be alone.  **love kira**   ranted: jan.8th 2004 feeling:headachy hey..well today was quite the weird day.. i wouldnt say it was bad..

you think you are moving forward the world seems to stop.. and you become motionless within its walls. some say everything happens for a reason.. and so i ask them this, is that just somthing you tell yourself in order for you to feel better about the status that your life is in? even kharma.. do some people really beleive that we get whats coming to us?? that if we do good only good can come out of it and vice versa , but why is that people who do deserve a break never get one?? life and way it works is 50% effort, and the rest.. is just luck..  **love kira**  ranted: dec.12th 2003

simple release. but please, i do not need you to save me. what i need is... hm im still trying to figure that out myself..   a simple reflection... i would look bak at the memories weve shared, memories evgraved in my soul and cry. bringing back all the pain was one of the most wounding things i could have done to myself. i learned that i was only doing this to myself. the memories had nothing to do with it. perhaps it was becuz i couldnt learn to just accept. nor quite understand the concepts of life. that we all live with the obstacles and barriers, to just find it in yourself to fight through, and now, when i look back, pain is no longer, tears fall but i smile.   breath... do you ever feel like the whole world is against you. you breath only because your body craves for oxygen, but wish itd be your last. you wake up in the morning, only because life makes you. making it so difficult for every day,hour,minute,second to pass by. i breath only because i have to...   inhale....exhale...repeat...  **love kira**  ranted: dec.11th 2003 feeling:alrite well hello.. today was quite good.. i guess lol i went to the library to do sum school work and got a book.. i wanted

       "\"             this  urllink korea times business section editorial  speaks of jwa seung-hee's (president of an economic research institute for the federation of korean industries) 10 mysteries of the korean economy.  #1 western-style economic reform has eroded the dynamism of the korean economy.  #2 seoul has become bigger and bigger despite the government's policy of balanced regional development.  #3 the rural community's life has become dismal despite the policy of promoting the balanced development of the rural and urban communities.  #4 income disparity has widened despite the policy of promoting egalitarianism and redistributive policies.  #5 competitiveness of small companies has weakened despite the policy of curbing chaebol.  #6 economic concentration has deepened despite the policy to diffuse the concentration of economic power.  #7 the exodus of primary, middle and high school students for overseas study has increased as the government seeks to standardize schools.  #8 government control of finance has deepened amid sloganeering for financial liberalization.  #9 the roh administration seeks to scrap the park chung-hee’s economic development model, which created the miracle on the han river. #10 the government has strengthened policies, which would erode corporate competitiveness.  to this business/economic list i'd like to add a cultural 10 mysteries of modern korean culture, if i may.  #1 koreans often speak of love for their children and the sanctity of marriage but many men (and women) have lovers on the side. #2 many korean parents (or grandparents) insist that children marry koreans, even though they send their kids overseas to study, or to hagwons (language academies) here. (n.i.m.f.t not in my family tree) #3 everyone seems to like the promise that is living in a different country, but very few can make the move out of korea. #4 koreans (especially the young) love the outdoors and clean air, but they hate to live in the country. #5 korean students hate learning english, but older ones seem to love taking english classes. #6 even after years of incredible progress koreans always compare themselves to foreigners: the rodeo drive of seoul, the silicon valley of korea, the harvard of korea. #7 most koreans seems to have a negative attitude toward u.s. soldiers here (especially those who served in katusa-korean army training with u.s. army) but they don't seem to want them to leave (and leave south korea vulnerable). #8 koreans spend 10-16 hours a day (for years on end) studying for major exams but at the end of it all don't seem to have a stored library of knowledge to use in everyday life (or even at work!). #9 koreans are very (over) protective of their children, and yet they have few child restraint seats and no one uses seatbelts in the back seats. #10 many koreans have dogs as pets, but many other koreans eat dog!  another interesting story came to me from a friend of mine. a group of 20 or so young people were on the subway when it came to a station with about 20 older folks waiting to get on.  the kids were sitting down in the seats, but without a word or any signals they all stood up together and offered their seats to the older folks.  unreal.  the more things change, the more things stay the same.         \""
